I have been a client at Fusion since they opened and I love this salon!&nbsp; It's warm, friendly and conveniently located right downtown in Glen Ellyn.&nbsp; I do have a regular stylist (Angela) however over the years I have been to or members of my family have been to all the stylists at Fusion and they are all terrific.&nbsp; I also typically purchase salon products at my appointments and the selection and prices cannot be beat. I love that I have a high quality salon, locally owned and operated where I live.&nbsp; If you visit this salon, you will not be disappointed!
