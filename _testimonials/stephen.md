I have known Angela McCarthy for a great many years……prior to the founding of Fusion.  I tend to be a loyal and reliable customer……if I like it and it is not broken I don't make changes.  Remaining a client of Angela's and of Fusion all these years has been made easy because of the level of service and friendship I have come to expect and which I receive.  Angela runs a nice salon which is always clean and orderly.  I find that Angela is quick to respond to my requests for appointments and is "flexible" when I need her to be from a scheduling standpoint.  I would highly recommend her and Fusion.  All are friendly, experienced professionals in my opinion.  You will not be disappointed.
