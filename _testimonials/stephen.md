Angela runs a nice salon which is always clean and orderly. I find that Angela is quick to respond to my requests for appointments and is "flexible" when I need her to be from a scheduling standpoint. I would highly recommend her and Fusion. All are friendly, experienced professionals in my opinion. You will not be disappointed.
