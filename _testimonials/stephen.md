I have known Angela McCarthy for a great many years......prior to the founding of Fusion. &nbsp;I tend to be a loyal and reliable customer......if I like it and it is not broken I don't make changes. &nbsp;Remaining a client of Angela's and of Fusion all these years has been made easy because of the level of service and friendship I have come to expect and which I receive. &nbsp;Angela runs a nice salon which is always clean and orderly. &nbsp;I find that Angela is quick to respond to my requests for appointments and is "flexible" when I need her to be from a scheduling standpoint. &nbsp;I would highly recommend her and Fusion. &nbsp;All are friendly, experienced professionals in my opinion. &nbsp;You will not be disappointed.
